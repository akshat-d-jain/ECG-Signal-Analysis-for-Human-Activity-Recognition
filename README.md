# ECG-Signal-Analysis-for-Human-Activity-Recognition
This project demonstrates a complete, end-to-end machine learning pipeline for analyzing physiological time-series data. Using an electrocardiogram (ECG) signal from the MHEALTH dataset, we extract meaningful features, train a classifier to recognize human activities, and discover hidden patterns in the data through unsupervised learning.
